# React Reddit Viewer

## About the project

This project was a little project done over Xmas 2020 to keep expanding my React skills.
The idea of the app takes top posts from various cycling subreddits and allows the user to see the top posts from defined subreddits.
As a user, you can also save posts and see them on the saved posts page and remove these saved items. The saved items are held in your browsers localstorage.
Clicking on a post, will take to you to that content on Reddit.

## Adapting the project

If you want to adapt the subreddits the app searches, you can edit the `defaultSubreddits.ts` file in the `data` file with the subreddits you want included.
